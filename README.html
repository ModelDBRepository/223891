This is the readme for the models associated with the papers:

Connelly WM, Crunelli V, Errington AC. (2016) Passive Synaptic
Normalization and Input Synchrony-Dependent Amplification of Cortical
Feedback in Thalamocortical Neuron Dendrites.
J Neurosci.  Mar 30;36(13):3735-5

Connelly WM, Crunelli V, Errington AC. (2015) The Global Spike:
Conserved Dendritic Properties Enable Unique Ca2+ Spike Generation in
Low-Threshold Spiking Neurons. J Neurosci.  Nov 25;35(47):15505-22.

This model was developed in Neuron 7.2.

The GUI will provide one click options to run certain simulations from
the above papers. Data is saved to tab delimited *.dat files which you
can then plot in other software.

mosint.hoc, along with rlgntc5-10-95.geo provide the model
description.

proc.hoc provides a small number of helper functions.

analysisProc.hoc provides a large number of simulation control
functions. Some of these are used in the paper, and some are not.

Example run:

After compiling the mod files and starting the simulation with
mosinit.hoc
(<a href="https://senselab.med.yale.edu/ModelDB/NEURON_DwnldGuide.html">https://senselab.med.yale.edu/ModelDB/NEURON_DwnldGuide.html</a>
has help if needed) if you press the "Generate Fig. 9C" button (2015
paper) the data file is generated and saved in a txt file in a minute
or so. You can use your favorite program to plot this. The sample
included matlab program simple_plot will graph this:
